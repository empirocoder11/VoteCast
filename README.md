## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose of Blockchain Based E-Voting

### Physical election systems that are prevalent have several drawbacks -
- Ballots can be internally tampered before or after vote casting
- Election system does not ensure transparency and security
- Voters need to trust election authority
- Double voting issue can occur

### CryptoCast, being a blockchain based E-Voting solution, addresses these issues by adpoting following schemes -
- Each ballot is **cryptographically signed** using election authority's *private key*
- Ballots are **tamper-proof** as those are digitally signed and verified by **smart contract** on the blockchain.
- **Double voting** is addressed by keeping registered voters' data on Blockchain
- Election authority does not have access to voter's ballot
- Elligible voters can only register for the election with their _National Identification Number_.

## :mega: How to Build


### Step-1 : Prepare Development Environment


1. #### Install [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
    - Head into the website & download.
    - **Tip: Use NVM version manager to flexibly install NodeJS)**

2. #### Install [Truffle Smart Contract Blockchain Framework](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle)
    - `$ npm install -g truffle`

3. #### Install [Ganache GUI](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache)
    - Head into the website & download.

4. #### Clone the repository
    - Download the repo to your local machine using `$ git clone`.

5. #### Install Project Dependencies using NPM

    - Change directory into the project root by `$ cd CryptoCast/` and run `$ npm install`

6. ####  Install [MetaMax extension](https://metamask.io/)

    - Install the extension based on your preferred web browser *(Chrome/Edge/Firefox)*

7. #### Install [Solidity Syntax Highlighter Package]() (Optional)

    - Based on your favorite text editor *(Atom/Sublime Text/VSCode)*, install *Solidity Syntax Highlighter Package* to properly highlight the solidity sources.


### Step-2 : Run the Project


1. #### Compile & Test

    - Run '$ truffle compile' and make sure the source is successfully compiled.

    - Tip: Remove **'build/'** folder and then compile for generating fresh new compilation artifacts of the sources.

2. #### Fire Up Ganache

    - Open Ganace and start local blockchain workspace
    - Make sure the Ganache port ID is same as the port specified under _'development'_ network in _truffle-config.js_.
    - Copy the deployed **'contract address'** and paste it on _contractAddress_ variable on 'src/js/app.js' script

3. #### Smart Contract Migration

    - Run `$ truffle migrate --reset` and wait for successful deployment of the contracts on the local blockchain.

4. #### Start Dev Server

    - Start Lite-Server using `$ npm run dev` on project root.


### Step-3 : Interact with the Dapp

1. Open your preferred browser in `http://localhost:3000`, with MetaMask activated and logged in
1. Connect MetaMax with running Ganache using 'Local RPC Server'option in settings.
1. Take any _fake account_ from ganache.
1. Register as a voter with NID, wait for transaction to be mined, and then refresh the page
1. Now you can vote and interact with the contract.
